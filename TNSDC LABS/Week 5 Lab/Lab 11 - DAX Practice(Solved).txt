Step 1: Load Data

Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on "Home" tab and select "Get Data."
Choose your data source, in this case, "Excel" or "CSV" to load the Sample Super Store dataset.
Load the dataset into Power BI.
Step 2: Create a Measure using AVERAGE DAX Function

In the "Fields" pane on the right, find the "Sales" numerical column.
Right-click on the column and select "New Measure."
In the formula bar, use the AVERAGE DAX function to calculate the average of the Sales column. The formula will look like this:
Step 3: Create a Card Visual

Go to the "Visualizations" pane on the right.
Select the "Card" visual to add it to your report canvas.
In the "Values" section of the "Visualizations" pane, drag and drop the "Average Sales" measure that you created in Step 2.
Step 4: Format the Card Visual

With the Card visual selected, you can format it to make it visually appealing.
You can change the title of the card to something like "Average Sales" by editing the "Title" property in the "Format" section of the "Visualizations" pane.
Step 5: Save and Publish

Once you are satisfied with the visualization, save your Power BI report.
You can then publish the report to Power BI service to share it with others.
Step 6: Refresh Data (Optional)

If your dataset is regularly updated, you can set up data refresh to keep your report up to date.
That's it! You've now successfully calculated the average of the "Sales" numerical column using the AVERAGE DAX function and displayed it using a Card Visual in Power BI.
