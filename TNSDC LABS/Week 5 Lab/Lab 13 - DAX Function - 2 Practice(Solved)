Step 1: Load Data

Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on the "Home" tab and select "Get Data."
Choose your data source, like "Excel" or "CSV," and load the Sample Super Store dataset.
Load the dataset into Power BI.
Step 2: Create a New Column Using MONTH DAX Function

In the "Fields" pane on the right, locate the "Order Date" date data type column.
Right-click on the column header and select "New Column."
In the formula bar, use the MONTH DAX function to extract the month number from the Order Date column. The formula will look like this:

Month Number = MONTH('YourTableName'[Order Date])


Step 3: Check the New Column

After creating the new column, you should see a column named "Month Number" with the corresponding month numbers in the data table.
Step 4: Use the New Column in Visualizations

You can use the newly created "Month Number" column in various visualizations to analyze your data by month.
For instance, you can create a bar chart where the x-axis represents the "Month Number," and the y-axis represents the sales amount or any other relevant metric.
Step 5: Format and Customize Visualizations (Optional)

Format your visualizations as needed to make them more informative and visually appealing.
Step 6: Save and Publish

Save your Power BI report.
If required, you can publish the report to the Power BI service to share it with others.
Step 7: Refresh Data (Optional)
