mport Data Sets:

Import the Products, Sales, and Stores CSV datasets into Power BI using the "Get Data" option.
Ensure that each dataset is properly loaded as a table.
Understand the Data Sets:

Review the structure and content of each dataset to understand the columns and their meanings.
Identify common columns that can be used to establish relationships between datasets (e.g., Product ID, Store ID).
Create Relationships:

Navigate to the "Model" view in Power BI to create relationships between the datasets.
Drag and drop the common columns (e.g., Product ID, Store ID) from one table to another to create relationships.
Establish relationships such as:
Products table linked to Sales table via Product ID.
Stores table linked to Sales table via Store ID.
Check Relationship Cardinality and Cross-Filtering:

Ensure that the relationship cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many) is set correctly based on the data.
Configure cross-filtering options to define how filtering in one table affects related tables.
Create Measures:

In the "Model" view, define calculated measures that involve columns from multiple tables. Use DAX expressions to create these measures.
Examples: Total Sales, Average Profit, Total Sales by Store, etc.
Design Visualizations:

Switch to the "Report" view to create visualizations using the combined data model.
Create charts, tables, and visuals that leverage the relationships and measures you defined.
Dashboard Creation (Optional):

If desired, create a dashboard to showcase key insights from your combined data model.
Add visuals and interactivity to the dashboard to facilitate data exploration.
Testing and Validation:

Test the data model's functionality and ensure that measures and visuals provide accurate results.
Validate that cross-filtering and slicing work as expected.
